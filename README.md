# Simple Todo App

This is a simple todo app that allows you to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. I built it in 2hrs as fun project. I also use it at home to keep track of my tasks with my family.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`
4. Run `npm run dev`
